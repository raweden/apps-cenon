vhf Import / Export library
2004-09-22

The vhf import/export library is a set of classes which allow the import and
export of DXF, HPGL, Gerber, DIN, as well as the import of PostScript/PDF
(using a standard PostScript interpreter like GhostScript or Display
PostScript).

The library imports primarily two dimensional data, the extension to three
dimensions (DXF, DIN) is not hard, however.

The library is written in Objective-C.
So far the library supports the following formats:

Import Formats
- DXF
  see supported language features in documentation
- G-Codes (drill data - DIN, Excellon, Sieb&Meyer, etc.)
  language configuration via configuration files (Device/din/)
- Gerber
  language configuration via configuration files (Device/gerber/)
  (extended Gerber as well as standard Gerber with aperture table)
- HPGL
  language configuration via configuration files (Device/hpgl/)
- PostScript / PDF
  needs a separate PostScript interpreter like GhostScript or
  a Display PostScript System installed.
- Adobe Illustrator
  support for loading AI prologue files is implemented. All you need
  are the header files with the prologues of the various AI versions.
- (Type 1 Fonts)

Export Formats
- DXF
- Gerber (RS274X)
  Export of extended Gerber including complex paths
- HPGL
- (Type 1 Fonts)
- a PostScript export is already part of the Mac-OS X / GNUstep system

Supported plattforms
- Mac-OS X 
- GNUstep libraries (Linux and other Unix derivated)
